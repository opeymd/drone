_If drones spy and dont pay off in 25 million$ deposits, it can suck a dick. If drones spy and dont kill off the real enemy, it can suck a dick. Suck my dick suck my dick suck my dick. My  DICK is very expensive._

## ROBOTS RAPING MY BRAIN
```mustread
How many times did you have thoughts that you never wanted to share with
anyone, and have been constantly worried at the thought of someone ever finding out
about these thoughts?
```
```mustread
All of us have been through this process, and the new and improved technologies
being developed around the world, supposedly to deal with crime and terrorism, and
inadvertently intrude on one's privacy, should probably bring us all to the brink of
paranoia.
```
```mustread
These technologies are funded by governments at the highest level and some of
the countries involved include USA, RUSSIA, CHINA, UK, Spain, Germany and France.

R.N.M. works remotely (ever wondered why have we all been driven relentlessly
towards wireless systems?) to control the brain under the objective to detect any
criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible culprit. Inevitable question:
How can you isolate a criminal thought if you do not have a comparative measure of non-criminal thoughts?
```
```mustread
This undertaking is based on two principles:
• The research studies have shown that the humanoid intellect thinks at a speed of
about 5 kilobits per second and, therefore, does not have the capability to contest
with supercomputers acting via satellites, implants and biotelemetry.
• The human brain has a characteristic set of bioelectric resonance structure. By
using supercomputers, the R.N.M. system can home in on it, and send messages
through an embedded individual's nervous system in order to affect their
performance in a preferred way.
```
```mustread
The entire system has been developed after about 50 years (!) of electromagnetic
human experimentation, claimed to be involuntary. According to many scientists
involved in this program (their names are not revealed for obvious reasons), within a
few years it is expected that DNA microchips, under the guise of medical
breakthroughs that will be presented to launch the disease cure processes on speed
and efficiency, will be implanted in the humanoid cereberum, which would make it
inherently controllable. R.N.M. will then have the ability to read and govern a person's
emotional mental procedures along with the involuntary and visions.
```

## I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK

- tithing / THE OUTCOME we live(d) to consume well above equal share demanding power over control of the last analysis. Life in war is mercy like fire is to cavemen. We can be squshed as easy a ant. We are probably on a last lession before the slate is wiped clean again. Gods Nature cant be changed no matter the supreme power it holds on earth and beyond. We can be put to sleep and rewoke as many times as needed to pay back all we take. These are Perfect days to die as we burn away. We are already mindwrpped or treated w alien drugs (shit from outerspace/ not earth) blocked off from gods original OBVIOUS nature. Telekenic magnit dust or gas from mars, intelligent, self evolving and mutating to adapt to the purpose. It wants to be god. It, satin, call it whatever, will be the death of us. Anything between us and God is destroyed if not moved out of the way. Thats a fact, and a well deserved one for everyone. Fuck what you think
